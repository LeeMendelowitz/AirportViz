Firing air traffic controllers is NOT a positive impact. And it would have made better sense if an airport in Ronald Reagan's home town or state (Illinois) gave him that sort of ""honor"". And it doesn't have to be a big or busy airport. Here in Georgia we have a Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in Americus GA, which is very close to his hometown of Plains.



At least the George Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport was built while George Bush was the local congressman who has some involvement in that airport being built in the 1960s. Reagan had nothing to do with National Airport.



And I'd say the same about JFK as he wasn't from New York. But Boston's (General Edward Lawrence) Logan Airport was already established. And having lived between LaGuardia and JFK I heard very few people call it Idlewild and most of those have died off now of old age."

I would like to think though that my opinion goes beyond party affiliation. I am a Democrat, yes, but I do respect and honor the many contributions and feats Reagan was able to accomplish during his tenure as President. But considering his presidency is not as aged as some of predecessors, I feel that the specific name of 'REAGAN National' is a huge stretch to be granted. He did already have a building in his name (I believe) before the airport added the President's name. If the airport was in name of George Washington - the city for whom it is named for, I believe I would have been more accepting as he is one of the many key, if not a MAJOR contributor in the creation of this nation - NOT Reagan. Reagan's term was limited to just dealing with the Russian/Communist 'threat.' I tend to also look at more... ""historical"" peoples. So those that were present during the creation of the Nation. And if not George Washington, then at least dedicate the name to honor the Native Americans... As Americans, I believe that is our CONTINUOUS faulting in life as we do little to respect the ancestry that was here before colonization had occurred. This area is rich in Native American history as well (Just look at the name Potomac for goodness sake!). But yes, the airport should just strictly be NATIONAL and identified as no person's name. I also feel that, nowadays, people find reasons or excuses to name buildings/structures after people. There are better ways to do that. Are their accomplishments and contributions to society's betterment not enough?? BWI should have also stayed BWI. I ignore the Thurgood Marhsall name as much as I do Ronald Reagan."

It's probably the airport in the world that's most associated with politicians.

When the Naming-Everything-After-Ronald-Reagan Frenzy began, I remember feeling, even as a teen, that it was a slap in the face. Naming landmarks after this president was an insult, especially in the DC area, a heavily Democratic region.The hagiography of Ronald Reagan is baffling to many, given the fact that thirty years later, his presidency and the policies that he advocated are revealed to have been a massive failure, creating the foundation of many of the crises that encumber us today. (Of course, Blacks, the poor and working class people could have told you that in the eighties, but no one was trying to hear that then. ""Stop complaining and Get back to pulling yourself up by those Boostraps, Fella!"")



It is deeply symbolic that Washington DC's airport is named after a figure who is so representative of the widening chasms that divide Americans. The presidential candidate who chose to invoke the importance of ""States' Rights"" just a few miles from Philadelphia, Mississippi at one of his first campaign speeches is a perfect figurehead for the sad, frightened people who ""want their country back.""

No matter party or politics--which changed over every few years anyway--everyone flew in and out of the ""National Airport.""  It was steady and the name was above any partisan agendas or squabbles.  



When they renamed National, it wasn't like renaming the Little Rock Airport after former multi-term Governor who grew up in the state and went on to become President of the US (though I'm sure naming that airport after the Clintons was a controversial decision, in its own right, it had some justification).  



The National renaming was different because Ronald Reagan wasn't from DC or the metro area and he did not represent ""Washington"" or ""Government"" any more than any other President does/has.  It was a forced elevation of a recent President above all others for specifically partisan purposes and to codify a specific storyline and partisan legend--long before history had its chance to form its own objective opinion.   That alone--and the related formal campaign to name something in every county in the United States for Reagan, a man who's performance was too recent and too symbolic of a movement for objective evaluation--were so cynical and made something so objective and pure, this idea of a non-partisan ""National Airport,"" into a forever tainted symbol of the partisanship and mind-games that make people hate politics.



When you threw in the shady way the voting occurred to make it happen, the blackmail of WMATA (Republicans in congress were willing to threaten the local economy and public transportation on a regional level to force station name and sign changes that WMATA and Arlington  were not obligated to make...and would come out of other budget funded by local riders, who opposed the changes) the whole thing still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I not only saw but was personally affected as a HUD employee by the efforts the Reagan administration undertook in 1981 to destroy efforts to improve public housing, increase safety, and empower the people who live in public housing. I volunteered for soup kitchens that, during the Reagan administration, began seeing not only homeless individuals but ENTIRE FAMILIES standing in line in the Minnesota winters to get a warm meal and a place to sit for a while. I saw the Immigration and Naturalization Service (as it was called at the time) cut its staff and the number of its centers, making it virtually impossible for many people to get real-time information and assistance in processing their inquiries and needs. I witnessed President Reagan refusing to say the word ""AIDS"" or to direct funds and services to addressing, understanding, and treating AIDS and HIV patients. I was right there when President Reagan ordered air-traffic controllers fired, decimating the right of people to organize and strike for their right to a fair wage and fair working standards. Some of my family members have suffered from the loss of those rights to organize. 



I have hundreds of more reasons, hundreds of examples of why I refuse to accept that President Reagan was a friend of air travelers, people who work for airlines, and millions of other people in the U.S. who were affected -- deeply, tangentially, or over and across time -- by his ""trickle-down"" economics, his entitled view toward his job as president, and his callous disregard for humanity.



Oh, yeah, and his convenient memory problems when he was called to question for all that. When exactly did those memory problems take effect, and why wasn't he ever -- even in his prime -- able to remember the people who were harmed and those who even died because of his presidency?"

Remember the cost of changing the Metro signs for this? ""The station retained its original name after the airport was renamed in 1998 from ""Washington National Airport"" to ""Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"". In early 2001, a letter signed by 24 members of Congress requested WMATA rename the station to conform. However, according to a Metro policy adopted in 1987, groups seeking to rename a station were required to pay the cost of replacing signs and maps. The Arlington County government, which could have made the change, demurredthe price was estimated at $400,000and WMATA subsequently declined to rename the station on April 19, 2001. In response, Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia threatened to withhold federal funding from the agency unless the station was renamed. Congress ultimately voted to require the renaming on November 30. According to then-General Manager Richard A. White, Metro paid to complete the renaming."" 



Isn't it ironic that the party of ""small government"" used federal power to strong-arm Metro into violating its own policy to make IT pay for THEIR hero worship?

At the same time, they also pushed through the naming of the massive federal building complex between Federal Triangle and 14th St. after Reagan, and in another ironic twist, the first agency to take up residence there was the EPA: the very agency that Reagan attempted to abolish.
